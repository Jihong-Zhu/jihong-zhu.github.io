Moving away from repetitive tasks, robots nowadays demand versatile skills that
adapt to different situations. Task-parameterized learning improves the generalization
of motion policies by encoding relevant contextual information in the task parameters,
hence enabling flexible task executions. However, training such a policy often
requires collecting multiple demonstrations in different situations.
To comprehensively create different situations is non-trivial thus renders
the method less applicable to real-world problems.
Therefore, training with fewer demonstrations situations is desirable.
This paper presents a novel concept to augment the original training dataset
with synthetic data for policy improvements, thus allows learning task-parameterized
skills with few demonstrations.
