Humans use contacts in the environment to modify the shape of deformable objects. Yet, few papers have studied the use of contacts in robotic manipulation. In this letter, we investigate the problem of robotic manipulation of cables with environmental contacts. Instead of avoiding contacts, we propose a framework that allows the robot to use them for shaping the cable. We introduce an index to quantify the contact mobility of a cable with a circular contact. Based on this index, we present a planner to plan robot motions. The planner is aided by a vision-based contact detector. The framework is validated with robot experiments on different desired cable configurations.
