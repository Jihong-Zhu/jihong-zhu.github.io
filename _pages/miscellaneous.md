## Basketball:
I started playing basketball since I was a child, although never been professionally trained, I never cease playing to date. My favourite basketball player is Kobe Bryant.

Influenced by a [childhood friend](https://mydramalist.com/people/74791-xu-zi-lai), I did freestyle basketball and performed (with him) during high school, and some solo performances in the university. An old performance video can be found at [freestyle basketball](https://youtu.be/91QNBn9gjJg)

I could still play some of the tricks.

## Travel:
I enjoy travel to new places. In fact, I have been living in four different countries in Europe (the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and France) since 2011. Places I lived (or am currently living):
* [York, the UK](https://www.visityork.org/visitor-information)
* [Delft, the Netherlands](https://www.delft.com/tourist-information-vvv-delft)
* [Hong Kong, SAR, China](https://www.discoverhongkong.com/uk/index.html)

## Cat:
I love cats. I adopted an orange-white colored cat in France and he accompanied me to the Netherlands. He will (hopefully) move to the UK with me soon.
